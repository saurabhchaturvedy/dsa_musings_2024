* Hi. What do you think is a single most important component required for a successful system design interview? What should we focus on the most while preparing for one? I bet this is knowledge. Knowledge of system design concepts and how to combine them together. And let me prove you that by walking you through all the stages of a typical system design interview. This is system design interview channel. And today we discuss how to count things at a large scale. So, the interviewer asks us to design a system that does counting.
* The problem may be articulated clearly, for example we need to count views for videos on Youtube. Or likes on Instagram or Facebook. But more often than that, the problem will be stated in a vague or a more general manner. For example, we may be asked to calculate not a single metric, like number of views, but a set of metrics. For example we need to monitor performance of different applications. Which means we need to count how many requests go through the service, how many errors service produce, average response time.

* And of course nothing stops the interviewer from stating the problem in a very generic form, like analyze data in real-time. What does data analysis mean? Who sends us data? Who uses results of this analysis? What real-time really means? These and many other questions need to be clarified. And even if system design problem seems clear to you, let me give you two big reasons why you still need to ask your interviewer questions. The first reason is really important for the interviewer. The second reason is important for you.
* The interviewer wants to see how you deal with ambiguity. Whether you can identify key pieces of the system and define a scope of the problem. And why it is so important for the interviewer - because she wants to understand how you will approach design problems in real life. System design interview problems are usually open-ended. It is impossible to solve such problems within 45 or 60 minutes interview. We should be clear on what functional pieces of the problem we are going to focus till the rest of the interview.
* And why requirements clarification is so important for us, interviewees? Mainly because there may be many solutions to the problem asked. And only when we fully understand what features of the system we need to design, we can come up with a proper set of technologies and building blocks. For example, let's take a problem of counting Youtube video views. If you ask this problem a software engineer with experience in SQL databases, he will explain you why MySQL database is a good fit. Engineer with profound experience in NoSQL databases will explain how to count things
* at large scale using for example Apache Cassandra database. We may use distributed cache to count stuff. Or apply stream processing techniques. Experts in cloud computing will solve this problem using public cloud services only. Engineers focusing on batch processing will solve this problem using for example Hadoop MapReduce. And views counting problem can indeed be solved using all these different approaches. But these options are not equal. Each has its own pros and cons. We should pick those options that address requirements.

Requirement Clarification
=========================

What we may want to ask about? My recommendation is to focus on the following 4 big categories: Users, where we want to understand who and how will use the system. Scale, where we want to understand how our system will handle a growing amount of data. Performance, where we want to know how fast our system must be. And cost, where we need to understand budget constraints. Let's see what specific questions in each category we may ask. Here and below we imply views counting system as an example. Who will use the system?

Is this all Youtube viewers who will see the total views count for a video? Or this is a per-hour statistics available to a video owner only? Or may be this total count will be used by some machine learning models to generate recommendations. How the system will be used? The data may be used by marketing department only to generate some monthly reports. In other words data is retrieved not often. Or data is sent to recommendation service in real-time. Meaning that data may be retrieved from the system with a very high pace.

Questions in this category help us understand what data we store in the system. Questions in the Scale category should give us a clue how much data is coming to the system and how much data is retrieved from the system. So, the questions we should ask: How many read queries per second the system needs to process. How much data is queried per request. How many video views per second are processed by the system. Should we deal with sudden traffic spikes and how big they may be. The interviewer will help us define these numbers.

Or we may assume some reasonable values. Questions in the performance category should help us quickly evaluate different design options. For example, if we can count views several hours later than these views actually happened, both batch data processing and stream processing design options can be considered. But if time matters and we need to count views on the fly, or in other words in real-time, batch data processing is not an option. It is just too slow. Another good question to ask, is to clarify how fast data must be retrieved from the system.

* And if interviewer tells us that response time must be as small as possible, it's a hint that we must count views when we write data and we should do minimal or no counting when we read data. In other words data must already be aggregated. And questions in the cost category should help us evaluate technology stack. For example, if asked to minimize development cost, we should be leaning towards well-regarded open-source frameworks. And if future maintenance cost is a primary concern, we should consider public cloud services
* for our design. Here is a little secret you might already know. During requirements clarification interviewer starts to understand your level of expertise in systems design. As with coding interviews, if you do not ask questions, this is a warning sign for the interviewer. And here is my advice: think along 4 categories mentioned here, think about data - what data, how it gets in and gets out of the system, and do not worry about time too much. You better spend additional 5 minutes clarifying requirements and scope than find yourself
* solving a different or more complex problem than the interviewer actually asked. The end goal of requirements clarification discussions is to get us closer to defining both functional and non-functional requirements. When we say functional requirements, we mean system behavior, or more specifically APIs - a set of operations the system will support. This is what our system will do. And when we say non-functional requirements, we mean system qualities, such as fast, fault-tolerant, secure. This is basically how a system is supposed to be.
* Let's define functional requirements first. And here is my practical advice. After figuring out what the system should do, you write it down on the whiteboard. In a few sentences. For example, we write down that the system has to count video view events. Count view events is the actual action the system performs and video becomes the input parameter. And if we want the system to calculate not just views, but a broader set of events, let's say likes and shares, we may generalize our API a bit and introduce event type parameter.
* This parameter indicates type of the event we process. We can go one step further and make the system calculate not only count function, but other functions as well, like sum and average. By supporting sum function we can calculate such metric as "total watch time" for a video. While average function can help us calculate average view duration. And we can even further generalize the API and say that the system will not just process events one by one, but a list of events as a single batch. Where each event is an object that contains information about a video, type of the event,
* time when event happened and so forth. Similar thought process can be applied for data retrieval API. We first write down something like: the system has to return video views count for a time period. Get views count becomes an action. While video identifier and start and end time become input parameters. If we want to retrieve count not only for video views, but for likes and dislikes for example, we can introduce event type parameter. And if we want our API return not just count statistics, but also statistics for sum and
* average, we should specify function as a parameter and name our API in a more generic way, like getStats. Following this simple technique will help you identify names of APIs, input parameters and, if needed, make several iterations to generalize APIs. Now, let's talk about non-functional requirements. Usually, the interviewer will not tell us specific non-functional requirements. Most likely, she will challenge us with mentioning big scale and high performance, as it is hard to achieve both at the same time.
* And we will need to find tradeoffs. In one of the previous videos I recommended to focus on scalability, performance and availability as top priority requirements. Let's use them here. We need to design a system that should handle tens of thousands of requests per second. We also want view count statistic to be returned in a matter of few tens of milliseconds. And we want view count statistics to be shown to users all the time. Even when there are network or hardware failures in the system. Although these 3 will be our primary concern, let's also talk about two other interesting

![img_12.png](img_12.png)

* requirements. Let's recall a CAP theorem and talk about consistency a bit. And I would like us to touch a cost minimization topic. And my advice is that you write down non-functional requirements on the whiteboard as well. It will help you later while choosing among several design options. We will talk more about this. Now, we have come to the next stage of a system design interview: high-level architecture. And we will start with something really simple. We need a database to store data. We will have a web service that processes incoming video view events and stores data

![img_13.png](img_13.png)

* in the database. To retrieve view counts from the database, let's introduce another web service. Nothing scary so far, right? And it should not be. At this point we do not yet have a clear vision of all pieces of the design. So, we just throw some very high-level components to the whiteboard. But what do we do next? High chances the interviewer is an expert in the field and knows the question very well. And she may start asking questions about any component we outlined in the high-level architecture.
* But we may not feel comfortable discussing any component just yet. Unless you are an expert in this field yourself, the whole picture may not yet be clear to you. This is in our best interest as interviewees to drive the conversation and move forward one step at a time. This is like assembling a puzzle. The interviewer can assemble the puzzle starting from any color group. But we need to start with something simple and construct the frame with the outside pieces first. So, what is this frame of outside pieces of a system design puzzle?
* It's data. And more specifically we need to think what data we want to store and how. Or using more professional terms we need to define a data model. We have two options for what data we want to store. We may store each individual video view event. Or we may calculate views on the fly and store aggregated data. When we store individual events we capture all attributes of the event: video identifier, timestamp, user related information such as country, device type, operating system and so on. When we aggregate data we calculate a total count per some time interval, let's say one
