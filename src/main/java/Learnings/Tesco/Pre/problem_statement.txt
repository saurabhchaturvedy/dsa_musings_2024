Draw a mix of high level/deployment diagram


Input to system: A Kafka Topic in which you are getting messages containing
Customer orders having customer ID and order amount. With every 100 rs spent,
customer gets 1 reward point. Based on reward points accumulated, customer gets rank.


Create two rest end points hosted on internet without authentication:


Input: N
Output: Top N customers based on rank
Input: Customer ID
Output: rank and reward points of this customer and +2 and -2 ranked customers.
For simplicity, Assume 1000 requests / messages per second at any point.
Also, assume millions of customers
If possible, choose open source and avoid public cloud as you will not be able to
detail about inner working of let's say a database.


Scalability and resilience are the main abilities that is the focus for now,
so don't worry about reducing hardware cost etc


What is the possible way to implement this If we have to update rank of million record on every order table?
Is this possible or we can update rank at interval through a scheduler.



The problem to Design a train booking system similar to IRCTC. The requirements were limited


To search train journeys between a given source and destination
Booking a seats on a train journey (emphasis was on handling concurrency)
Cancel a booking
I stumbled in this round as I was a bit overwhelmed due to the limited time and didn't manage to approach the problem systematically, but kept at it and came up with an abstract design.
